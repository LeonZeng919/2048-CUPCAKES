        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: September 24, 2024</p>

        <p>2048cupcakes.fun ("2048 Cupcakes") operates 2048cupcakes.fun. It is 2048 Cupcakes' policy to respect your
            privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, 2048 Cupcakes collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
            web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 2048 Cupcakes' purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how 2048 Cupcakes' visitors use its website. From time to
            time, 2048 Cupcakes may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
            a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

        <p>2048 Cupcakes also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses for logged in users. 2048 Cupcakes only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to 2048 Cupcakes' website choose to interact with 2048 Cupcakes in ways that require 2048
            Cupcakes to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 2048 Cupcakes
            gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at
            2048cupcakes.fun to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 2048
            Cupcakes – by purchasing access to the premium features of the 2048 Cupcakes game, for example – are asked
            to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
            process those transactions. In each case, 2048 Cupcakes collects such information only insofar as is
            necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with 2048 Cupcakes. 2048
            Cupcakes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors
            can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them
            from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
        <p>2048 Cupcakes may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. 2048 Cupcakes may display
            this information publicly or provide it to others. However, 2048 Cupcakes does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

        <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>2048 Cupcakes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
            those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
            order to process it on 2048 Cupcakes' behalf or to provide services available at 2048 Cupcakes' website, and
            (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
            organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 2048 Cupcakes' website, you consent to
            the transfer of such information to them. 2048 Cupcakes will not rent or sell potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 2048 Cupcakes discloses potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
            other governmental request, or when 2048 Cupcakes believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
            necessary to protect the property or rights of 2048 Cupcakes, third parties or the public at large.</p>

        <p>If you are a registered user of the 2048 Cupcakes website and have supplied your email address, 2048 Cupcakes
            may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
            up to date with what's going on with 2048 Cupcakes and our products. We primarily use our blog to
            communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a
            request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
            order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 2048 Cupcakes takes
            all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
            of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

        <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>If 2048 Cupcakes, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 2048
            Cupcakes goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
            transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
            acquirer of 2048 Cupcakes may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, 2048 Cupcakes may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
            and in 2048 Cupcakes' sole discretion. 2048 Cupcakes encourages visitors to frequently check this page for
            any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a 2048 Cupcakes account, you might also receive an alert
            informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
            constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
